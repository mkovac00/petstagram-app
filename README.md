# petstagram

Petstagram is a project for a university class. The project was created with the help of multiple
sources but most of the project was done by following a Udemy course for MERN technologies.

It was created using React for the frontend and MongoDB, Node and Express for the backend.



# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT

To run the project simply download all the provided files in both the petstagram-frontend and
the petstagram-backend folder, open them both inside an IDE and download the necessary node
dependencies using the 'npm install' command.
After successfully downloading all the necessary node packages run both the frontend and backend
seperately in their own terminals using the 'npm start' command.



# CREDITS

All the code for the project was written by me, Kovač Mario, and my university colleague Sorić Frane. 
We are both currently students at FESB Split.
